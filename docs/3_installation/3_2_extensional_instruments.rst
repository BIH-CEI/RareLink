Extensional REDCap Instruments
===============================

.. attention::
   To use your local REDCap project, you will need to set up a local REDCap 
   instance. For this please contact your local REDCap administratior. A project
   name could for example be "RareLink - Your local REDCap location". 

This section provides a guide for developing REDCap instruments around the
RareLink CDM that can also be processed by the Phenopacket and FHIR pipeline.
If the rules are followd upon development of the REDCap sheets, another 
subsequent mapping step will be required to convert the data into the
Phenopackets or FHIR format. For this second step guides are given below, too. 

.. note::
    This section is still to be implemented in the docuemntation.
