Setup a REDCap Project
========================

   To use your local REDCap project, you will need to set up a local REDCap 
   instance. For this please contact your local REDCap administratior. A project
   name could for example be "RareLink - Your local REDCap location".

    This section is still to be implemented in the docuemntation and the RareLink
    command line interface.

Via the RareLink CLI type:

.. code-block:: bash

    rarelink framework-setup redcap-project-setup start


This command guides you through the steps to set up your REDCap project, 
including contacting your local REDCap administrator and ensuring API access for your project.
