Setup a REDCap Project
========================

.. attention::
   To use your local REDCap project, you will need to set up a local REDCap 
   instance. For this please contact your local REDCap administratior. A project
   name could for example be "RareLink - Your local REDCap location". 

.. note::
    This section is still to be implemented in the docuemntation and the RareLink
    command line interface.

Via the RareLink CLI type:

.. code-block:: bash

    rarelink setup -project
