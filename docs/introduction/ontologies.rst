Ontologies and Terminologies
=============================

RareLink uses a variety of ontologies and terminologies to standardise the 
representation of data and facilitate interoperability between different data 
sources. These ontologies and terminologies are used to describe the phenotypic 
and genotypic features of rare diseases (RDs) and their associated genes, as 
well as the relationships between them. The use of standardised vocabularies 
ensures that data can be easily integrated and queried across different 
databases and platforms.

- An `ontology<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780444517876500039>``
is a formal and explicit representations of the concepts and relationships 
within an area of healthcare designed to facilitate the organisation, 
integration, and exchange of knowledge across healthcare systems and 
applications.
