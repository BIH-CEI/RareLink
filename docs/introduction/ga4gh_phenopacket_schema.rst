The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Phenopacket Schema is a standard for representing
phenotypic and genotypic information in a structured format. It is designed to facilitate the exchange
of phenotypic and genotypic data between different systems, platforms, and organizations, promoting
interoperability and data sharing in the genomics and health domain.
