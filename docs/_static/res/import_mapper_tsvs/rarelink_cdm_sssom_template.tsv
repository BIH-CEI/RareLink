# RareLink-CDM SSSOM Template File
# This template maps source data elements to target RareLink-CDM schema elements.
# The following columns are included:
# subject_id:        Unique identifier for the source record.
# subject_label:     Human-readable label for the source record.
# predicate_id:      Fully qualified target element (e.g., rarelink:snomedct_184099003).
# predicate_label:   The title of the target element from the schema (e.g., "2.1 Date of birth").
# object_id:         The target value (literal for dates or standardized code for coded fields).
# match_type:        How the mapping was derived (e.g., "lexical").
# mapping_date:      Date when the mapping was created.
# mapping_tool:      Method used to create the mapping (e.g., "manual").

# --- Example of Repeating Elements ---
# The same patient (e.g., ADR001) can have multiple entries for repeated elements.
# For instance, if ADR001 has two phenotypic features, include two rows with the same subject_id.
