RareLink Documentation
====================================

RareLink is a novel framework designed for managing and processing rare disease (RD) 
data within the REDCap. Rare diseases affect over 260 million individuals 
worldwide, yet data quality and scarcity pose significant challenges in research 
and clinical care. RareLink aims to standardize and streamline RD data management 
by providing a structured project setup that ensures consistency across data collection
instruments, variables, and data dictionaries. This setup allows the linkage and export
to the international standards HL7 FHIR and the GA4GH Phenopacket Schema.
