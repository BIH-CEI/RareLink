Welcome to the RareLink REDCap Documentation!
=============================================

RareLink is a novel framework designed for managing and processing rare disease 
(RD) data within the REDCap. Rare diseases affect over 260 million individuals 
worldwide, yet data quality and scarcity pose significant challenges in research 
and clinical care. RareLink aims to standardize and streamline RD data management 
around REDCap by providing a structured project setup that ensures consistency 
across data collection instruments, variables, and data dictionaries. This setup
allows the linkage and export to data the standards HL7 FHIR and the 
GA4GH Phenopacket Schema.
