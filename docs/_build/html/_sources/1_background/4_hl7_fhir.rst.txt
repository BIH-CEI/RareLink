HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)
=====================================================

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is an international standard
developed by HL7 for exchanging healthcare information electronically. Initially
designed as a transaction format to facilitate data exchanges between healthcare
systems, FHIR provides a flexible and modular framework. While it is essential
for ensuring interoperability across healthcare information systems, its role as
a transaction format means that it may not always provide the precision needed
for complex rare disease (RD) analysis. However, it remains a critical tool for
enabling the smooth exchange of healthcare data between different platforms
and applications.

In the context of rare diseases, FHIR plays a key role in improving data sharing
across institutions and research centers. Due to the scarcity and fragmentation
of RD data, standardized data exchange is crucial. FHIR enables the
standardization of clinical and genomic data, ensuring that RD-specific
information, such as phenotypic traits and genetic variants, can be captured and
shared in a structured manner. Despite its limitations in handling the 
complexity of some RD data, FHIR's widespread adoption ensures that RD data can 
be integrated with other healthcare information systems, making it easier to
collaborate and share insights across various fields.

The International Patient Summary (IPS) is a FHIR-based standard that aims to 
provide a concise, standardized summary of a patient's key health information. 
This summary is designed to facilitate seamless healthcare transitions, 
particularly for patients with complex health needs, such as those with rare 
diseases. By standardizing data elements such as medications, allergies, and 
relevant medical history, the IPS enhances communication between international 
healthcare providers. This is especially important for RD patients, as the 
inherent data scarcity requires data exchange and research on an international
level - such as by the [European Reference Networks (ERNs)](https://health.ec.europa.eu/rare-diseases-and-european-reference-networks_en).
