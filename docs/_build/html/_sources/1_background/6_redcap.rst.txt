REDCap
======

REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a web- and survey-based application 
designed to capture data and create databases and projects for clinical research
by the Vanderbuilt University. As an open-source tool, REDCap has gained 
widespread adoption across university hospitals, research institutes, and other 
healthcare institutions due to its flexibility and cost-free availability. One 
of the primary advantages of REDCap is its ability to be hosted locally within 
the clinical information system of a hospital. This ensures that sensitive data 
captured through REDCap remains within the hospital’s infrastructure, enhancing 
data privacy and security.

Although REDCap provides a highly flexible environment for data collection, it 
does not natively define or enforce standardized variables. This lack of native 
definitions for variables can lead to inconsistencies in data capture across 
different projects and institutions, potentially hindering data exchange and 
interoperability. To address these issues, a wide range of modules and add-ons 
have been designed and developed, allowing users to extend REDCap's 
functionality and tailor it to specific research needs. The REDCap API also 
allows for seamless integration with external systems, enabling automated data 
transfers and further enhancing the platform’s utility in research environments.
