Generate GA4GH Phenopackets
============================

The Phenopacket Mapper module allows users to generate GA4GH Phenopackets from REDCap data.

Rarelink predefines a set of mappings between REDCap data and GA4GH Phenopacket fields. 
The Phenopacket Mapper module uses these mappings to generate GA4GH Phenopackets from REDCap data.

These mappings are defined in a configuration file that is provided with the Phenopacket Mapper module. 
All data from the RD CDM can be exported to GA4GH Phenopackets using the Phenopacket Mapper module.
For all data extending the RD CDM, we predefined a set of mappings that can be used to generate GA4GH Phenopackets.
These mappings specify how data in REDCap should be coded and formatted to generate GA4GH Phenopackets.
