Introuction RareLink
====================

RareLink was developed as a response to the widespread challenges in rare disease (RD) data management, 
specifically the lack of interoperability and standardization within REDCap systems. The framework 
ensures that RD data is captured, processed, and exported following a predefined common data model
 that facilitates downstream analysis using international standards.

The integration of ontology codes and the connection to the BioPortal Ontology Server enables researchers
 and clinicians to use standardized terminologies, ensuring that data can be easily shared and reused
 across different platforms and research networks. By leveraging HL7 FHIR and the GA4GH Phenopacket Schema, 
 RareLink supports the creation of interoperable and reusable RD datasets, making it a critical tool for 
 both clinical care and research in rare diseases.
