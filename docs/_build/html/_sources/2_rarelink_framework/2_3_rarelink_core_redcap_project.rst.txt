Core REDCap Project
====================

The RareLink Core REDCap Project is a comprehensive framework designed specifically for rare disease (RD) research and care. At the core of RareLink is the Rare Disease Common Data Model (RD CDM), which integrates pre-configured REDCap sheets, instruments, and project setups. This framework ensures that data capture is both consistent and compliant with international standards, such as HL7 FHIR and GA4GH Phenopackets, without the need for additional coding or mapping. As a result, RareLink allows researchers and clinicians to collect and process rare disease data seamlessly within the REDCap environment.
