RareLink CDM Instruments
=========================


In this section, we provide an overview of the instruments that are part of the
RareLink Common Data Model (CDM). These instruments are designed to capture
data in a standardized format that is compliant with international standards,
such as HL7 FHIR and GA4GH Phenopackets. By using these instruments, researchers
and clinicians can ensure that the data they collect is interoperable and can be
shared across institutions, facilitating collaboration and improving the potential
for meaningful research and clinical advancements in rare disease care.
