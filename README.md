## Project Description

RareDIF (Rare Disease Interoperability Framework) is a comprehensive framework in REDCap for rare disease data 
management in clinical care or research. It enables data capture, processing, import and export to the international
interoperability standards HL7 FHIRÂ® and the GA4GH Phenopacket SchemaÂ©.

## Features

REDCap is a clinical electronic data capture system, for which many university hospitals have licenses. RareDIF bases
on our Common Data Model for Rare Diseases based on the ERDRI-CDS, HL7 FHIR, and GA4GH Phenopackets. Our data model can
be found in our ART-DECOR project [_RD CDM_](https://art-decor.org/ad/#/erker-/project/overview) (_you may need to
deactivate your adblock for this website_). For disease-specific data capture and analyses, recommendations to extend
our RD CDM are given here (tbc). For further information regarding DCDEs (Domain Specific Data Elements)
please read: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35594066/

[RareLink Abstract.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16783170/RareLink.Abstract.pdf)

This framework encompasses the following features for RD data management: 
1. *Native REDCap usage*: downloadable REDCap forms of all [_RD CDM_](https://art-decor.org/ad/#/erker-/project/overview) sections, documentation and manuals for installing and setting up your local REDCap project, manual data capture guides, connecting BioPortal, and preparing your REDCap API
2. *Semi-Automated Data Capture (from Tabluar Data)*: Utilities and manuals mapping tabular data to the [_RD CDM_](https://art-decor.org/ad/#/erker-/project/overview), including a user-friendly GUI, API connection, and clear instructions for each section
3. *GA4GH Phenopacket Pipeline*: generating validated GA4GH Phenopackets of all [_RD CDM_](https://art-decor.org/ad/#/erker-/project/overview) possible, connected with an API, a GUI and precise documentation. So far, this work is based on the [ERKER2Phenopackets](https://github.com/BIH-CEI/ERKER2Phenopackets) Pipeline. 
4. *Automated Export to local HL7 FHIR Resources or HL7 FHIR server*: utilising the integrated [_toFHIR_ Module](https://github.com/srdc/tofhir), generating local HL7 FHIR Resources generated from REDCap forms with automated export and record linkage with existing HL7 FHIR servers.
5. *Automated import of HL7 FHIR resources to RECap*: HL7 FHIR resources are automatically imported to a local REDCap project & database using the CDIS-Module.

## Getting Started

Instructions on how to set up and run your project locally please read the docs here(tbc). To provide a short overview:
1. Set up your local REDCap license and project
2. Install packages necessary and activate REDCAp API for you project
3. Run the installation packages defined below for the specific functionalities you want to use linked to your local 
REDCap API.
4. Run the functionalities you need to generate HL7 FHIR resources or GA4GH Phenopackets 

### Prerequisites

Software, libraries, or dependencies that need to be installed before setting up the project can be found in detail in 
our docs here. As a brief overview you need the following:
